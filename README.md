## TO DO
* Functionality for opponent replying
    * Countering with JSN
    * Giving money
    * Choosing where to place a given forced deal property
* Functionality for choosing which cards to discard (only max 7 in hand)
* Make money rendering into table with card and number of those cards (visually better as game goes on, a lot of money cards in a list is hard to read)
